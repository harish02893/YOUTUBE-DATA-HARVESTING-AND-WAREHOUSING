YouTube Data Harvesting and Warehousing is a project that aims to provide users with the ability to access and analyze data from numerous YouTube channels. SQL, MongoDB, and Streamlit are used in the project to develop a user-friendly application that allows users to retrieve, save, and query YouTube channel and video data.

TOOLS AND LIBRARIES USED:
This project requires the following components:
1.	STREAMLIT: The Streamlit library was used to create a user-friendly UI that enables users to interact with the program and carry out data retrieval and analysis operations.
2.	PYTHON: Python is a powerful programming language renowned for being easy to learn and understand. It is the primary language employed in this project for the development of the complete application, including data retrieval, processing, analysis, and visualization.
3.	GOOGLE API CLIENT: The googleapiclient library in Python facilitates communication with different Google APIs. Its primary purpose in this project is to interact with YouTube's Data API v3, allowing the retrieval of essential information like channel details, video specifics, and comments. By utilizing googleapiclient, developers can easily access and manipulate YouTube's extensive data resources through code.
4.	MONGODB: MongoDB is built on a scale-out architecture that has become popular with developers of all kinds for developing scalable applications with evolving data schemas. As a document database, MongoDB makes it easy for developers to store structured or unstructured data. It uses a JSON-like format to store documents.
5.	MYSQL: MySQL is an open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) known for its reliability and extensive features. It provides a platform for storing and managing structured data, offering support for various data types and advanced SQL capabilities.
